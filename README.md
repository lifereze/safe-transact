# Description of the App
* A financial app that acts as an intermediate between a tenant and a landlord whereby the app handles the deposit cash from the tenant and all the legal bindings. In a scenario where a tenant wants to withdraw from the contract, the landlord confirms that the vacated room is okay and the app can proceed and issue the tenant with the deposit cash. The product addresses Tenant-Landlord dispute with a long-term solution.
